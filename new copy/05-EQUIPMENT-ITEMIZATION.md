# COURIER - EQUIPMENT & ITEMIZATION
**Power Budget System & Item Strategy**

---

## POWER BUDGET SYSTEM

### Core Innovation
The Power Budget System is Courier's primary solution to power creep and meaningless loot progression. Instead of constantly increasing numbers, the system creates a strategic puzzle where players must optimize limited "power budget" across all equipment.

**The Problem Solved**:
- Traditional ARPGs inflate numbers endlessly (10 damage → 10,000 damage)
- Eventually, all items become vendor trash except slight upgrades
- Power progression becomes about bigger numbers, not interesting choices

**Our Solution**:
- Every character has finite total power budget based on level
- Items consume budget based on stats provided
- Higher rarity = same stats for less budget cost
- Every item drop creates strategic decisions

## POWER BUDGET MECHANICS

### Base Formula
**Total Power Budget = 100 + (Level × 20) + Paragon Levels**

**Examples**:
- Level 1: 120 total power budget
- Level 30: 700 total power budget  
- Level 60: 1,300 total power budget
- Level 60 + 50 Paragon: 1,350 total power budget

### Budget Consumption
Every equipped item consumes power budget based on:
1. **Base Stats**: Attributes, flat bonuses
2. **Percentage Modifiers**: Damage%, resistance%, etc.
3. **Special Effects**: Unique abilities and triggers
4. **Rarity Efficiency**: Higher rarity = lower budget cost

### Power Cost Examples
**Flat Stats**:
- +1 Attribute = 1 power
- +10 Health = 1 power
- +5 Shield = 1 power

**Percentage Stats**:
- +1% Damage = 5 power
- +1% Resistance = 3 power
- +1% Critical Chance = 8 power

**Special Effects**:
- Unique abilities = 50-200 power
- Legendary effects = 100-300 power
- Set bonuses = varies by power level

## RARITY EFFICIENCY SYSTEM

### Efficiency Multipliers
Higher rarity items provide the same stats for less power budget:

- **Common (Gray)**: 1.3× power cost (30% penalty)
- **Uncommon (Green)**: 1.15× power cost (15% penalty)  
- **Rare (Blue)**: 1.0× power cost (baseline)
- **Epic (Purple)**: 0.9× power cost (10% discount)
- **Legendary (Orange)**: 0.8× power cost (20% discount)
- **Mythic (Red)**: 0.8× power cost (20% discount)
- **Primal (Cyan)**: 0.75× power cost (25% discount)

### Strategic Examples

**Common Weapon Example**:
- Base stats worth 200 power
- Common efficiency: 200 × 1.3 = 260 power cost
- Uses 20% of level 60 budget (260/1300)

**Primal Weapon Example**:
- Same base stats worth 200 power
- Primal efficiency: 200 × 0.75 = 150 power cost
- Uses 11.5% of level 60 budget (150/1300)

**The Choice**: Use the efficient Primal weapon and have budget for other gear, or use multiple Common items for different stat combinations?

## STRATEGIC ITEMIZATION

### Build Philosophy Examples

#### **Glass Cannon Strategy**
**Goal**: Maximum damage output
**Approach**: 
- 1-2 Primal weapons (high efficiency damage)
- Minimal armor (budget saved for weapon power)
- Accept low survivability for maximum offense
**Power Budget**: 80% weapons, 20% armor

#### **Balanced Optimization**  
**Goal**: Well-rounded effectiveness
**Approach**:
- Mix of Epic/Legendary items across all slots
- Balanced stat distribution
- Good efficiency without extreme specialization
**Power Budget**: 40% weapons, 60% armor

#### **Defensive Specialist**
**Goal**: Maximum survivability  
**Approach**:
- Primal armor for efficient defensive stats
- Basic weapons (budget saved for defense)
- Focus on resistances and health
**Power Budget**: 20% weapons, 80% armor

#### **Elemental Master**
**Goal**: Status effect optimization
**Approach**:
- High elemental damage weapons
- Gear supporting status effect generation
- Balanced investment for sustained effects
**Power Budget**: 50% weapons, 50% supporting armor

### Empty Slot Strategy
**Valid Tactic**: Sometimes leaving slots empty is optimal
**Example**: Level 60 player with 1,300 power budget
- 3 Primal items (450 power) may be more effective
- Than 9 Common items (850+ power) with worse efficiency
- Remaining budget saved for future upgrades

### Upgrade Decisions
Every item drop creates strategic questions:
- **Efficiency**: Does this item provide better power budget efficiency?
- **Build Synergy**: Do the stats support my elemental choices?
- **Opportunity Cost**: What am I giving up by equipping this?
- **Future Planning**: Do I have budget room for planned upgrades?

## ITEM MODIFICATION SYSTEM

### Enhancement Levels (+1, +2, +3)
Items can be enhanced to improve their effectiveness:

**+1 Enhancement**:
- +25% to all stat bonuses
- Costs: Common Enhancement Cores + Credits
- Success Rate: 100%
- Visual: Golden glow effect

**+2 Enhancement**:
- +50% to all stat bonuses  
- Costs: Rare Enhancement Cores + Components
- Success Rate: 85% (failure destroys materials)
- Visual: Bright golden aura

**+3 Enhancement**:
- +75% to all stat bonuses
- Costs: Exotic Enhancement Cores + rare materials
- Success Rate: 60% (failure can destroy item)

### Enhancement Strategy
**Risk vs Reward**: Higher enhancement levels provide more power but risk item destruction
**Budget Impact**: Enhanced items provide more stats for same power budget cost
**Investment Decision**: Enhance current gear or save materials for better base items?
