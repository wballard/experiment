# COURIER - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Game Vision & Core Innovation**

## GAME IDENTITY

**Courier** is a web-based sci-fi ARPG that combines deep character progression, strategic equipment optimization, and asynchronous mission gameplay. Players send their characters on timed missions with outcomes determined by statistical models based on character builds, equipment choices, and mission parameters. This web version focuses on the strategic depth of character building while a separate 3D action version handles real-time combat.

## CORE INNOVATION: POWER BUDGET SYSTEM

### The Problem
Traditional ARPGs suffer from power creep where new content must constantly introduce higher numbers to feel meaningful, eventually leading to damage inflation and meaningless choice between items.

### Our Solution
Every character has a finite "power budget" that limits the total strength of all equipped gear combined. Higher rarity items provide the same stats more efficiently, creating meaningful trade-offs:

**Example Scenario**: 
- A Level 60 player has 1,300 total power budget
- Finding a 400-power Primal weapon means using 30% of total budget on one item
- **Choice**: Massive efficiency on one piece vs. spread power across more items
- **Result**: Every item drop creates a meaningful decision

### Key Benefits
- **Prevents Power Creep**: Numbers stay reasonable throughout game's lifespan
- **Meaningful Choices**: Every equipment decision has trade-offs
- **Build Diversity**: Multiple paths to achieve power goals
- **Progression Preservation**: Early items can remain useful if power-efficient
