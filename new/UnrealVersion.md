# COURIER - UNREAL ENGINE 3D VERSION
**Real-Time Combat ARPG/Looter Shooter Reference**

---

## VERSION DISTINCTION

This document preserves the original design concept for Courier as a real-time 3D ARPG/looter shooter. This version would feature direct player control, real-time combat, and traditional shooter mechanics, while maintaining the same progression systems, power budget innovation, and strategic depth.

**Key Difference**: This version features real-time player-controlled combat instead of the web version's asynchronous timer-based statistical missions.

## GAME IDENTITY (3D VERSION)

**Courier** is a sci-fi ARPG/looter shooter that combines the depth of Diablo IV, the skill complexity of Path of Exile 2, the gunplay of Destiny 2, and the weapon customization of Call of Duty. Players explore procedural content with real-time combat while unraveling the mystery of the Progenitor experiments on the colony world of Orphan.

**Platform**: PC/Console with Unreal Engine 5
**Perspective**: Third-person or first-person (player choice)
**Combat**: Real-time action with elemental effects
