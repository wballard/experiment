This document contains all prompts used in the conversation that led to the creation of the unified Courier game design documents, preserved in chronological order for reference and process documentation.

---

### **Prompt 1: Initial Conflict Analysis**
```
review all the markdown documents in this directory and make a list of conflicting design choices
```

**Context**: User requested analysis of existing game design documents to identify inconsistencies and conflicts that needed resolution.

**Outcome**: Comprehensive analysis identifying 10 major conflict areas including character progression, elemental systems, power budget mechanics, and more.

---

### **Prompt 2: Document Unification Request**
```
can you combine these documents into one coherent document, asking me to resolve conflicts as we go?
```

**Context**: User wanted to merge all conflicting documents into a single coherent design while getting input on conflict resolution.

**Outcome**: Interactive conflict resolution process where each major system was presented as options for user decision.

---

### **Prompt 3: Character Progression Resolution**
```
option A with the following changes: 1. merge change fortitude to defense 2. change level cap to 60 and add a simple paragon system that increases power by 1 per paragon level 3. cap total skill points at 60
```

**Context**: User selected Option A (traditional ARPG system) but with specific modifications to level cap, attribute naming, and skill point allocation.

**Outcome**: Established character progression foundation: Level 60 + Paragon, 6 attributes (Defense instead of Fortitude), 60 skill points total.

---

### **Prompt 4: Power Budget System Selection**
```
option a
```

**Context**: User chose cost multiplier system for rarity efficiency where higher rarity items have lower power costs.

**Outcome**: Confirmed power budget system using cost multipliers (Common 1.3×, Rare 1.0×, Primal 0.75×).

---

### **Prompt 5: Elemental System Resolution**
```
document a elemental wheel, option a status effect build
```

**Context**: User selected specific elemental adjacency wheel and percentage-based status buildup system.

**Outcome**: Established Earth → Ice → Electricity → Fire → Nature → Earth wheel with percentage-based status calculations.

---

### **Prompt 6: Weapon System Clarification**
```
option a. 6 weapon archetypes. we can keep the seven slot mod system for now, but we will revist that
```

**Context**: User initially mentioned 6 weapon archetypes but then corrected to 5 base archetypes with modification variants.

**Outcome**: Confirmed 5 base weapon archetypes with 7-slot modification system (marked for future revision).

---

### **Prompt 7: Weapon Archetype Correction**
```
my mistake 5 archetypes with the ability to make variants that are similar to other archetypes which should be covered in one of the docs. option a for armor.
```

**Context**: User corrected weapon count and confirmed armor slot structure.

**Outcome**: Finalized 5 weapon archetypes with variant creation through modifications, 7 armor slots.

---

### **Prompt 8: Currency and Mission System Simplification**
```
option c for now, we will revisit this. let's remove reaid mission type. the affix system and scaling mission systems are important. also change strike to horde.
```

**Context**: User simplified currency system and modified mission structure.

**Outcome**: Simplified currency system, 3 mission types (Patrol, Horde, Expedition), confirmed affix system importance.

---

### **Prompt 9: Final System Confirmations**
```
keep those 5 classes, but they will need to have additional work done to create skill trees which will we do in a future pass. skill points can be spent in the primary class tree or the elemental trees that the player unlocks. for now let's eliminate bar chart stats and keep everything numbers or ranges
```

**Context**: User confirmed class system and skill allocation while requesting numerical stat display only.

**Outcome**: Confirmed 5 classes with skill trees for future development, skill points split between class and elemental trees, numerical display only.

---

```

**Context**: User wanted the unified design organized into multiple focused documents with navigation.

**Outcome**: Created `/new` directory with 9 organized documents and comprehensive table of contents.

---

### **Prompt 11: Onboarding Addition Request**
```
we need a section before the character systems that walks through how a player starts the game, gets some basic equipment, runs their first mission, etc. to ease into the game and introduces them to the basics. this would include account creation, creating initial character, "entering the game", etc. and describes the principle modality which is playing on the web.
```

**Context**: User identified need for new player experience documentation focused on web-based gameplay.

**Outcome**: Created comprehensive Player Onboarding document covering web-first design, tutorial progression, and retention strategies.

**Outcome**: Detailed gameplay experience description covering strategic optimization, elemental combinations, and progression systems.

---

### **Prompt 13: Web-Only Clarification**
```
this ersion of the game will be web only and combat missions are asynchronous with timers and outcomes determined by simple stastical models. there will be a 3d playable version of the game too, but that is out of scope for this document
```

**Context**: Critical clarification that this version is web-based with asynchronous missions, not real-time combat.

**Outcome**: Major revision of documents to reflect asynchronous timer-based missions with statistical outcomes instead of real-time combat.

---

### **Prompt 14: 3D Version Preservation**
```
please put start a new document called UnrealVersion that keeps all the previous material (ie: playing a 3d looter shooter version instead of a web only game) for reference
```

**Context**: User wanted to preserve the real-time combat design as a separate reference document.

**Outcome**: Created UnrealVersion.md preserving all real-time combat mechanics and 3D gameplay concepts for future reference.
