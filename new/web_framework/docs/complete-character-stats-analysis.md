# Complete Character Stats Analysis - Current vs. Specification

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Primary Attributes (Dashboard - Hardcoded)
**Current Names vs. Spec Names:**
```
CURRENT          →    SPECIFICATION
vigor           →    vitality         (Health & Survivability)
focus           →    precision        (Critical & Accuracy)  
force           →    potency          (Raw Damage & Status)
momentum        →    alacrity         (Speed & Agility)
resonance       →    capacity         (Resources & Abilities) 
defense         →    defense          (Defense & Resistances)
```

**Current Scaling (Level-based, Hardcoded):**
```javascript
vigor:     250 + (level-1) * 15     // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation
focus:     300 + (level-1) * 10     // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation  
force:     220 + (level-1) * 12     // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation
momentum:  180 + (level-1) * 8      // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation
resonance: 200 + (level-1) * 10     // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation
defense:   150 + (level-1) * 7      // Should be: 20 base + player_allocation
```

### Secondary Stats (Dashboard - Displayed)

#### **Offensive Stats (Current Implementation)**

```

#### **Status in Database (character_stats table)**
Currently only stores:
```sql
critical_strike_chance_percent = 0.1
```
All other stats are **not stored anywhere** - just hardcoded display values.

### Skill System Implementation (Partially Working)

#### **Skill Modifiers (skill-modifiers.js) - PARTIALLY CORRECT**
```javascript
// These stat types are correctly implemented:
critical_strike_chance_percent    // Works - stored in DB
fire_rate_percent                 // Works - calculated
reload_speed_percent              // Works - calculated  
damage_reduction_percent          // Works - calculated
damage_percent (typed)            // Works - fire/ice/electric damage bonuses
resistance_percent (typed)        // Works - elemental resistance bonuses
```

#### **Skill Effects from Specs (elemental-skills.html)**
```

## What Stats SHOULD Exist (Based on Specifications)

### Primary Attributes (Player-Allocated, Spec-Compliant)
```
vitality     = 20 + allocated_points     (120 total points to allocate)
precision    = 20 + allocated_points     (2 points per level, 60 levels = 120)
potency      = 20 + allocated_points     (Player chooses distribution)
alacrity     = 20 + allocated_points  
capacity     = 20 + allocated_points
defense      = 20 + allocated_points
```

### Derived Stats (Calculated from Attributes + Equipment + Skills)

#### **Health & Survivability**
```
health                = base + (vitality * 5) + equipment + skills
shield_capacity       = base + (vitality * 2) + equipment + skills  
health_regeneration   = base + (vitality * 0.1) + equipment + skills
damage_reduction      = base + (defense * 0.1%) + equipment + skills
```

#### **Critical Strike System**  
```
critical_chance       = base + (precision * 0.5%) + equipment + skills   [CAP: 50%]
critical_damage       = base + (precision * 0.2%) + equipment + skills
accuracy              = base + (precision * 1%) + equipment + skills
weak_spot_damage      = base + equipment + skills
```

#### **Damage System**
```
all_damage_percent    = base + (potency * 0.8%) + equipment + skills
primary_weapon_dps    = weapon_damage * damage_multipliers * attack_speed
secondary_weapon_dps  = weapon_damage * damage_multipliers * attack_speed  
melee_dps            = melee_damage * damage_multipliers * attack_speed
```

#### **Elemental Damage (Typed)**
```
fire_damage_percent   = base + equipment + skills (fire mastery)
ice_damage_percent    = base + equipment + skills (ice mastery)  
electric_damage_percent = base + equipment + skills (electric mastery)
nature_damage_percent = base + equipment + skills (nature mastery)
earth_damage_percent  = base + equipment + skills (earth mastery)
```

#### **Speed & Agility**
```
attack_speed_percent  = base + (alacrity * 0.4%) + equipment + skills
movement_speed_percent = base + (alacrity * 0.4%) + equipment + skills
reload_speed_percent  = base + (alacrity * 0.2%) + equipment + skills  
cooldown_reduction    = base + (alacrity * 0.2%) + equipment + skills
fire_rate_rpm         = weapon_base_fire_rate * (1 + attack_speed_percent)
```

#### **Energy & Abilities** 
```
max_energy            = base + (capacity * 3) + equipment + skills
energy_regeneration   = base + (capacity * 0.2%) + equipment + skills
ability_damage_percent = base + (capacity * 0.5%) + equipment + skills
```

#### **Resistances (All Capped at 75%)**
```  
fire_resistance       = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%]
ice_resistance        = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%] 
electric_resistance   = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%]
nature_resistance     = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%]
earth_resistance      = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%]
physical_resistance   = base + (defense * 0.2%) + equipment + skills    [CAP: 75%]
```

#### **Status Effect System**
```
status_effect_chance  = base + (potency * 0.3%) + equipment + skills
status_effect_duration = base + (potency * 0.1%) + equipment + skills  
stun_resistance       = base + (defense * 0.15%) + equipment + skills
slow_resistance       = base + (defense * 0.15%) + equipment + skills
poison_resistance     = base + (defense * 0.15%) + equipment + skills
burn_resistance       = base + (defense * 0.15%) + equipment + skills
freeze_resistance     = base + (defense * 0.15%) + equipment + skills
```

#### **Weapon-Specific Stats**
```
weapon_range          = weapon_base_range + equipment + skills
weapon_accuracy       = base_accuracy + (precision * 1%) + equipment + skills
armor_penetration     = base + equipment + skills
```

#### **Power & Resource Management**
```
power_max             = 300 + (level - 1) * 50 + equipment_bonus    [ALREADY CORRECT]
power_used            = sum_of_equipped_item_power_costs            [ALREADY CORRECT]  
power_available       = power_max - power_used                     [ALREADY CORRECT]
```

## Current Character Events (Inadequate)

### **Current Events**
```sql
-- Only 1 trigger exists:
update_power_on_level_up  -- Updates power_max, skill_points, last_played
```

### **Required Events (Specification-Compliant)**
```
levelup           -- Character gains level(s)
skillchange       -- Skill points invested/respecced  
equipitem         -- Item equipped to slot
unequipitem       -- Item removed from slot
attributechange   -- Attribute points allocated (NEW - missing entirely)
paragonlevel      -- Post-60 progression (future)
```

---

## Critical Problems Identified

### 1. **No Stat Storage System**
- Only `critical_strike_chance_percent` is stored in database
- All other 40+ stats are hardcoded display values
- No calculation engine exists for derived stats

### 2. **No Attribute Allocation System**  
- Players cannot allocate the 120 attribute points specified
- Attributes are hardcoded level-based calculations
- Missing the core character customization mechanic

### 3. **Incomplete Skill Integration**
- Skill system exists but doesn't affect most displayed stats
- Dashboard shows hardcoded values instead of skill-enhanced stats  
- No connection between skill investments and character power

### 4. **Missing Event-Driven Architecture**
- No unified system for stat recalculation
- No event tracking or history
- Stats don't update when equipment/skills change

### 5. **Specification Mismatch**
- Attribute names don't match specification  
- Stat formulas don't match specification
- Missing status effect and resistance systems

## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)**
1. **Attribute System** - Add player-allocated attribute points (120 total)
2. **Stat Storage** - Store all derived stats in `character_stats` table
3. **Calculation Engine** - Build system to calculate derived stats from sources
4. **Event System** - Add character events for reactive stat updates

### **Phase 2: Integration (High Priority)**  
1. **Dashboard Updates** - Display calculated stats instead of hardcoded values
2. **Skill Integration** - Connect skill system to stat calculations
3. **Equipment Integration** - Equipment bonuses affect derived stats
4. **API Endpoints** - Expose stat calculation and attribute allocation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)**
1. **Status Effect System** - Implement status resistances and durations
2. **Combat Integration** - Use calculated stats in combat simulator  
3. **Real-time Updates** - Live stat updates as changes are made
4. **Build Planning** - Preview stat changes before committing

### **Phase 4: Polish (Low Priority)**
1. **Stat Tooltips** - Show breakdown of where each stat comes from
2. **Stat History** - Track stat changes over time
3. **Build Comparison** - Compare different attribute/skill allocations
4. **Export/Import** - Share character builds

This analysis reveals that the current system is essentially a **display mock-up** rather than a functional character stat system. The foundation needs to be completely rebuilt to match the Courier specifications.
