## Design Considerations for Future Classes

### Integration Requirements
1. **Same 60-point system** with 6 tiers
2. **5-point tier gates** like core classes
3. **3 specialization paths** per class
4. **Weapon integration** that feels unique
5. **One ultimate choice** at Tier 6

### Development Priorities
1. **Cartographer** (Lowest complexity)
   - Reuses movement systems
   - Waypoints are simple buffs
   - Minimal new VFX needed

2. **Vanguard** (Medium complexity)
   - Stance system needs UI work
   - Reuses existing combat mechanics
   - Clear visual stance indicators

3. **Technomancer** (High complexity)
   - Drone AI requirements
   - Multiple entity management
   - Hacking visualizations

4. **Engineer** (Highest complexity)
   - Deployable placement system
   - Structure interactions
   - Extensive VFX for buildings

### Unique Selling Points
- **Cartographer**: Only class that modifies movement fundamentally
- **Technomancer**: Pet class with tactical options
- **Vanguard**: Jack-of-all-trades with moment-to-moment decisions
- **Engineer**: Tower defense elements in action format

### Balance Considerations
Each class should offer something no current class provides:
- Cartographer vs Infiltrator: Team mobility vs personal stealth
- Technomancer vs Doctor: Offensive summons vs support totems
- Vanguard vs Outlaw: Adaptability vs specialization
- Engineer vs Sentinel: Area control vs personal defense

### Elemental Synergies
Each class should have clear elemental preferences:
- **Cartographer + Electric**: Speed and chain attacks
- **Technomancer + Fire/Electric**: Drone damage types
- **Vanguard + Any**: True flexibility
- **Engineer + Earth/Ice**: Defensive structures

These classes would significantly expand tactical options while maintaining the core game's skill-based progression system.
