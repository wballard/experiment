# COURIER - MISSION & CONTENT SYSTEMS
**Progressive Challenges & Affix Variety**

---

## MISSION PHILOSOPHY

Courier's mission system provides scalable, replayable content through asynchronous timer-based missions with outcomes determined by statistical models. Character builds, equipment optimization, and weekly rotating affixes determine success probabilities and reward quality. Three core mission categories offer different time commitments and risk/reward profiles.

**Core Principles**:
- **Statistical Outcomes**: Mission success determined by character build vs mission requirements
- **Timer-Based Gameplay**: Real-time mission duration with completion notifications
- **Affix-Driven Variety**: Weekly modifiers change success calculations and strategies
- **Build Optimization**: Equipment and attribute choices directly impact success probability
- **Risk vs Reward**: Higher difficulty missions offer better rewards but lower success rates
