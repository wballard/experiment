# COURIER - ELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM
**The Five Elements & Status Effects**

---

## ELEMENTAL PHILOSOPHY

The elemental system forms the tactical core of Courier's combat, where traditional gunplay meets strategic elemental effects. Five distinct elements each offer unique approaches to combat, with powerful status effects that fundamentally alter encounter dynamics.

**Core Principles**:
- All damage can be enhanced with elemental effects
- Status effects build up based on damage dealt relative to enemy health
- Each element has distinct tactical identity and counterplay
- Elemental combinations create powerful synergies

## THE FIVE ELEMENTS

### Element Wheel & Adjacency Rules

**üåç Earth ‚Üí ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice ‚Üí ‚ö° Electricity ‚Üí üî• Fire ‚Üí üåø Nature ‚Üí üåç Earth**

**Adjacent Element Restrictions**:
- **Level 20**: Choose any of the 5 elements
- **Level 40**: Choose second element (must be adjacent to first)
- **Valid Combinations**: Earth+Ice, Ice+Electricity, Electricity+Fire, Fire+Nature, Nature+Earth

**Design Intent**: Forces meaningful choices and prevents overpowered combinations while enabling powerful dual-element strategies.

## STATUS BUILDUP SYSTEM

### Universal Formula
**Buildup Percentage = (Elemental Damage Dealt √∑ Enemy Maximum HP) √ó 100**

**Core Mechanics**:
- Calculation occurs AFTER all resistances and damage modifiers
- Each element tracks buildup independently on each enemy
- Weaker enemies reach status effects faster (tactical scaling)
- Buildup decays over time when not refreshed

**Design Benefits**:
- Gear progression remains meaningful (more damage = faster buildup)
- Tactical scaling (weak enemies affected quickly, bosses require sustained effort)
- Clear feedback loop between damage investment and status frequency

### Buildup Thresholds

**Progressive Intensity (0-99%)**:
- **0-24%**: Minor effects, visual indicators
- **25-49%**: Moderate effects, clear progression
- **50-74%**: Strong effects, noticeable impact
- **75-99%**: Severe effects, major tactical changes

**Triggered State (100%)**:
- **Powerful Effect**: Unique to each element
- **Duration**: 2-5 seconds depending on element
- **Immunity Period**: Brief immunity after effect ends
- **Tactical Window**: Opportunity for follow-up actions

## ELEMENTAL DAMAGE INTEGRATION

### Damage Modifier Types

**"+X% Damage as [Element]"**:
- Converts percentage of existing damage to elemental type
- Example: 100 physical damage + 25% as Fire = 100 physical + 25 fire
- Applies to all damage sources (weapons, abilities, etc.)

**"+X [Element] Damage"**:
- Flat elemental damage addition
- Example: +15 Fire Damage adds 15 fire damage to each hit
- Stacks with other flat damage bonuses

**"+X% [Element] Damage"**:
- Multiplies existing elemental damage of matching type
- Example: 50 fire damage + 100% Fire Damage = 100 fire damage
- Only affects damage already of that element type

### Multi-Element Interactions

**Independent Tracking**:
- Each element maintains separate buildup percentage
- Multiple status effects can be active simultaneously
- Cross-element synergies provide tactical depth

**Example Multi-Element Scenario**:
```
Enemy Status:
- 60% Fire Buildup (6% HP/s burn DoT)
- 40% Nature Buildup (20% life steal for team)  
- 80% Earth Buildup (+16% damage vulnerability)

Combined Effect:
- Fire DoT deals 6% HP/s, amplified by earth vulnerability
- Team heals for 20% of ALL damage dealt to this enemy
- All damage sources benefit from earth vulnerability
```
